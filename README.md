# Information and search system: polyclinic (registry)

During the execution of this work, methods of data visualization were studied for easier perception by the user, improvement of skills in predicting human behavior to create the most understandable interface and to prevent possible errors and when recording data in the database.

An information system was developed for the registration point of the polyclinic. The main directions for creating a search system for processing, classifying information and performing a search based on selected data are defined.

The basic principles of SQLite-based database design, construction, and management were studied, which made it possible to achieve maximum organization of the data structure, their reliable storage, and easy access for changing and processing large volumes of interdependent information.

Thus, working software was developed in C# using a class library, Windows Forms, DB, queries to it, regular expressions and basic data visualization methods.
